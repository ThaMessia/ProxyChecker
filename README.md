# ProxyChecker
As you maybe noticed I am not programming much in these days because of university stuff. 
I found a lot of time to program in Christmas holiday so here you are.

The idea of creating a proxy checker has been given by a friend of mine named ZavierKiller who said (in Italian) "Yeah man but your booter doen't have a proxy checker". Initially I thought of saying him about my private version I use for SUS OBJECTIVES (yeah I often bot minecraft server with my tools but with owners' permissions) and the fact that my private version has a proxy checker, but then I thought that creating another proxy checker was the best idea.
