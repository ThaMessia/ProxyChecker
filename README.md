# ProxyChecker
As you maybe noticed I am not programming much in these days because of university stuff. 
I found a lot of time fpr programming in Christmas holiday so here you are.

The idea of creating a proxy checker has been given by a friend of mine named ZavierKiller who said (in Italian) "Yeah man but your booter doen't have a proxy checker". Initially I thought of saying him about my private version of DivineBooter I use for SUS THINGS and the fact that this version has a proxy checker, but then I thought that creating another proxy checker was the best idea.
